# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Blood-Pressure-Data
Project 3, CS 6313 Statistical Methods for Data Scientists

This project represents 3rd/6 projects completed during STAT 6313 course.

BP : This dataset contains one measurement of systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) made by each of two methods—a finger method and an arm method—from the same 200 patients

Part 1 of the project analyses the data collected in paired design scheme and performs exploratory data analysis by examining the distributions of the measurements from the two methods using boxplots and Using histograms and QQ plots to examine the shapes of the two distributions.

Part II of the project performs Monte Carlo Study to examine the accuracy of Large Sample Confidence Interval for a population proportion
